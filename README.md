<p>This is a standalone application for exploring Particle Spring Systems (PSS) as a method of finding structural forms written in Java using the <a href="https://www.processing.org">Processing API</a> for graphic elements, geometry, rendering and GUI. This application is interactive allowing the user to fully control the simulation as it is running and be able to adjust the equilibrium position for each form. It can be used as a tool for design and analysis of structural forms in real time. The implementation uses custom data structures for particle springs and an Euler forward solver. For more information, please read the accompanying writeup (file <em>InteractOptimGridShells.pdf</em>).</p>

<p>An early work on using PSS for structural form finding is Killian, A. &amp; Ochsendorf, J. <a href="http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/744e.content.03334.pdf">Particle-Spring Systems for Structural Form Finding</a>, <em>Journal of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures (IASS)</em>, 46 (147), 2005.</p>

<p>Another interesting and very useful resource are the following <em>SIGGRAPH lecture notes</em> on <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs448b-00-winter/papers/phys_model.pdf">Physically Based Modeling</a>. You will find all information you need for understanding particle spring systems and their use for simulating physical structures, including cloth and surface structures.</p>
